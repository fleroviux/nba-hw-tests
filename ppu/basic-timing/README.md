# basic-timing

This test measures basic timing within a single scanline:
- H-blank DMA start time (relative to when VCOUNT changes)
- H-blank flag set and unset time (relative to H-blank DMA)
- V-count coincidence flag set and unset time (relative to H-blank DMA)
- H-blank IRQ assertion time (relative to when VCOUNT changes)
